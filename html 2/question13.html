    <p>The information in the form of oral speeches or written text that is passed on from one person to another is known as knowledge.<br><br>
        The amount of human knowledge canâ€™t be measured in terms of Gigabyte or terabyte.<br><br>
        The quest for knowledge is a journey without a destination and human beings should not stop that quest.<br><br>
        Our knowledge on the working and the origin of the universe is very limited.<br><br>
        Scientists and engineers work day in and day out for many years to gather knowledge on how the universe works.<br><br>
        Wisdom stems from the knowledge a person has gained  over years or decades.<br><br>
        Knowledge might not come necessarily by experience but will come through avid reading and interacting with people.<br><br>
        The scientific knowledge and theory that are postulated decades back has given rise to the technological revolution that we are witnessing today.<br><br>
        Even when we human beings think that we have enough knowledge on the working of the universe, nature keeps throwing new phenomenon at us as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.<br>
        <br>
        The day human beings stop their quest for knowledge is the day the progress of human civilization ceases.<br></p>
